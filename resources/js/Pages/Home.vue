            As of 2022 I've been employed by Nexxen (formerly Tremor Video) as a Technical Solutions Engineer for their demand side platform. I am not currently seeking new employment, but inquiries are always welcome. My resume is hosted here as well if needed.

            I love media and writing about it! I'll review anything I feel the need to and host it all on this site, and I'll surely wax poetic about the subject on my blog. Go check out the archives if that interests you!

            I do my best to update consistently, but sometimes life gets in the way."

            The Lorem ipsum text is derived from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of Cicero's De finibus bonorum et malorum.[7][8] The physical source may have been the 1914 Loeb Classical Library edition of De finibus, where the Latin text, presented on the left-hand (even) pages, breaks off on page 34 with

            The discovery of the text's origin is attributed to Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar at Hampdenâ€“Sydney College. McClintock connected Lorem ipsum to Cicero's writing sometime before 1982 while searching for instances of the Latin word consectetur, which was rarely used in classical literature.[2] McClintock first published his discovery in a 1994 letter to the editor of Before & After magazine,[9] contesting the editor's earlier claim that Lorem ipsum held no meaning.[2]
